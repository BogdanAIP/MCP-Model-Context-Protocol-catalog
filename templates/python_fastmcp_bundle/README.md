# MCP Bundle Starter (Python FastMCP)

This is a generated skeleton for a composite MCP server that bundles tools across products.
- Populate `.env` with required keys (from chosen providers).
- Run `python app.py` for stdio mode (or switch to HTTP).

You will extend `app.py` with provider-specific tools (generated stubs or prebuilt adapters).
